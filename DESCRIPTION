Description: This package adds some functions when fitting mixed models in R packages, functions including:
    batch analysis for mixed models in R packages, such as 'lme4', 'nlme','breedR' and 'asreml'. Also includes
    other functions to calculate standard error for heritability or correlation. Some functions have been 
    created to be used in conjunction with the R package 'asreml' for the 'ASReml' software, which can be
    obtained upon purchase from 'VSN' international(<http://www.vsni.co.uk/software/asreml>). Also some 
    functions is conjuncted with the R package 'breedR' which can be freely obtained from 'github'
